PEP : Python Enhancement Proposal
- a collection of guidelines, best practices, descriptions of (new) features and implementations, 
as well as processes, mechanisms and important information

** 3 types: **
- Standards Track PEPs, which describe new language features and implementations;
- Informational PEPs, which describe Python design issues, as well as provide guidelines and 
    information to the Python community;
- Process PEPs, which describe various processes that revolve around Python (e.g., propose 
    changes, provide recommendations, specify certain procedures).

defines:
- Python’s Steering Council, i.e., a five-person committee and the final authorities who accept or reject PEPs;
- Python’s Core Developers, i.e., the group of volunteers who manage Python, and;
- Python’s BDFL, i.e., Guido van Rossum, the original creator of Python, who served as the project’s Benevolent 
    Dictator For Life until 2018, when he resigned from the decision-making process.
