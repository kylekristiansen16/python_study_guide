XML = eXtendable Markup Language
    eXtenable: you can define your own tags
    Markup: it's a language for marking up text
    Language: it's a language, not a data format

XML is a language - universal and transparent carrier
- invented before JSON
- invented for the same reason as JSON, but so different

Each XML document contains...
    - a header (optional)
    - a root element (mandatory) and only exactly one
    - any (including 0) number of child elements
    - any (including 0) number of attributes
    - any (including 0) number of comments
    - any (including 0) number of processing instructions

doc:

<?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "utf-8"?>          # declares that the document contains XML text
<!-- cars.xml - List of cars ready to sell -->      # a comment. It means nothing. The XML parser will ignore it completely
<!DOCTYPE cars_for_sale SYSTEM "cars.dtd">          # defines the document type. NAME [SYSTEM | PUBLIC] "URI"
<cars_for_sale>                                     # root element
   <car>                                            # child element #1
      <id>1</id>                                    # element content (attributes)
      <brand>Ford</brand>
      <model>Mustang</model>
      <production_year>1972</production_year>
      <price currency="USD">35900</price>           # element attribute CURRENCY is defined inside tag 
   </car>
   <car>                                            # child element #2          
      <id>2</id>
      <brand>Aston Martin</brand>
      <model>Rapide</model>
      <production_year>2010</production_year>
      <price currency="GBP">32000</price>
   </car>
</cars_for_sale>

notes:
- has a header, uses attribute = value pairs, version and encoding, a program responsible for parsing a fileâ€™s content knows what to expect next
- comments are ignored by the parser, signified by <!-- and -->
- documents can be self-defining or specified by a DTD (Document Type Definition - metadata about the XML document)
- DTDs are a document describing the structure of an XML document
- XML document consists of elements. Each element is marked by a pair of tags: an opening tag and a closing tag
- <empty/> is an empty element, no closing tag
- XML allows us to put as many attributes inside a tag as we need

# most currently implemented services use JSON, not XML. 
# It's highly possible that you may encounter a server which implements communication on exchanging XML documents, but JSON is much more popular.
