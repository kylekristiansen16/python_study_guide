working on a project and found that a manual invoking of your own callback can simplify your code
what can you do? 

invoke the invoke() method of the widget which is the target of the callback
- the invoke() methods purpose is to simulate a click on the widget

----

the message widget 
- can automatically format it's inner text
- is very similar to the Label widget

----

there are 2 ways to set a widgets properties:
- wdg.config(property=value)
- wdg[property] = value
